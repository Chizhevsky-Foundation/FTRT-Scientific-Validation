DEDICATION:
This project is dedicated to the memory of Alexander Leonidovich Chizhevsky 
(1897-1964), who chose truth over convenience, and science over persecution.

His 16 years of imprisonment for defending his scientific ideas serve as a 
reminder that the pursuit of knowledge requires not only intelligence, but 
also courage and integrity.
